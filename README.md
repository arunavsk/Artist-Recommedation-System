# Artist-Recommedation-System
A very basic recommendation program that recommends artists to users based on hybrid=collaborative+content based model.

Part of Siraj Raval's weekly programming challenge.

## Getting Started
I would recommend using Linux/Mac for this as installing the dependency lightfm on Windows is nearly impossible.

Please follow Siraj's [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBC9R-msAk) to get started.

### Dependencies
* lightfm
* numpy
* matplotlib
### Editor
* Sublime Text 2

## Running the code.

From terminal/command prompt -
### Usage
```
python main.py
```
## Result
The challenge was to check for a bunch of classifiers which performs better.
Here I have used `matplotlib` to plot a horizational bar graph and compare different classifiers in terms of accuracy.
