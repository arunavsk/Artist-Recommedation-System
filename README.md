# Artist-Recommedation-System
A very basic classification program that classifies an individual as 'male' or 'female' based on features such as height, weight and shoe size.

Part of Siraj Raval's weekly programming challenge.

## Getting Started
I would recommend using [Anacoda](https://www.continuum.io/what-is-anaconda) for this if you are on Windows as all packages/dependencies gets installed.

On Linux/Mac, please follow Siraj's [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg) to get started.

### Dependencies
* sk-learn
* numpy
* matplotlib
### Editor
* Sublime Text 2

## Running the code.

From terminal/command prompt -
### Usage
```
python main.py
```
## Result
The challenge was to check for a bunch of classifiers which performs better.
Here I have used `matplotlib` to plot a horizational bar graph and compare different classifiers in terms of accuracy.
